### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Public Service / Navigation
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes posts the accidents by writing posts, taking pictures and videos. Users are also allowed to comment and share others' posts.
- **Market:** We plan to take campus area in the United States as our primary playground, due to the transportation data availability.
- **Habit:** If you live in a dangerous neighborhood... You will love it.
